## Getting Started

I'm using pnpm by default, to start the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Improvements

- I'm using react query for caching purposes (performance) and currently only support modern browsers, therefore we should use polyfills for the old browsers.
